Ganglia-Gmetric-XS

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

To build XS module, We need some libraries and header files which bundled
ganglia tarball. so firstly we configure and make ganglia source.

Before build ganglia, I strongly recommend applying patch for fix
libganglia's memory leak.

    cd WORKDIR
    wget http://dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ganglia/ganglia-3.0.X.tar.gz
    tar zxf ganglia-3.0.X.tar.gz
    cd ganglia-3.0.X
    patch -p1 THIS_MODULE_DIR/patch/ganglia-3.0.7-fixed_gmetric_pool.patch
    ./configure && make

next, run perl Makefile.PL specifying gaglia build directory by --ganglia-dir
option or environment variable $GANGLIA_DIR.

    perl Makefile.PL --ganglia-dir=WORKDIR/ganglia-3.0.X --enable-clear-pool
      OR if you do not apply patch
    perl Makefile.PL --ganglia-dir=WORKDIR/ganglia-3.0.X
    make
    make test
    make install
